## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

The crux of this project was centered around the functionality of the buttons. To ensure a satisfying user experience, the the response to each question is only shown when the user clicks on the button. Additionaly, if any other response is shown when click anther question, that first response is closed. This was solved by storing the state of every button.
